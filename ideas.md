Ideas:
- Every book should have authors
- Add authors page
- Every book can have many editions
- Each edition should have a number of pages, language and title (if it's a transation)
- Every book should have original title and original language
- Every table (books, authors) should allow filtering only owned books
- These requirements would require using flexible api (GraphQL?)
